I'm a computer science phd student from [VILab](https://vilab.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/), [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). My research interest includes computer vision, MLLM, Video understanding.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. shawn](https://shawnshenjx.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/computer-science/), University of Bristol.
